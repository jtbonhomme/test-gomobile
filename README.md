# test-gomobile

This repos creates an ios bundle (`test-gomobile.app`) without needing XCode.
The code builds an autonomous application thanks to `gomobile` library.

The `Makefile` commands are:
* `make build` to build and generate the bundle (`test-gomobile.app`)
* `make deploy` to install the bundle on a connected device
